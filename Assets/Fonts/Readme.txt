Fonts for GB Studio version two

Made by Jeremy Oduber in 2020

---------------------------------------

Fonts formatted for easy use with GB Studio to add a little variety to your Game Boy Games. Comes in three full variations: thick, slanted, and tiny, which include full alphanumerics and common punctuation and symbols. Also includes combinatory variants so you can mix bolded or italic text with your normal text.

Extras: 

	-Dark background versions of all fonts, including the default GB Studio font.
	-Pixel port of Frengertype, a font available in my Triad of Fonts package https://jeremyoduber.itch.io/triad-of-fonts Not particularly readable, but very scifi.
	-Dark version of GB Studio default frame.png so dark fonts don't look out of place.

Instructions: Download and unzip. Files are divided by folder. Replace the default ascii.png file in assets/ui of your GB Studio project folder. That's it.

Credit isn't necessary, but always appreciated!
